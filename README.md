# Hi there, I'm Safin Ghoghabori 👋

I am a working professional with experience in building web applications and mobile applications. <br/>
Other than this, I also have an inclination towards design, playing sports, and exploring new stuff. <br/>
Let's [connect](safinghoghabori65@gmail.com) and geek out on any of the topics mentioned. I'm all ears. 

# 💻 Tech Stack, I've worked with 🧰
* **Frontend:** ReactJS, React-Native, Redux, TypeScript, Web Technologies(HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Web Performance
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Databases:** SQL, MongoDB

I, personally, believe programming is more about articulating and organization than picking a random framework 🤷
